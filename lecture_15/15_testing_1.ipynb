    "Having seen the dramatic impact of undetected mass balance errors, it is natural to ask how they can be detected. There are two general approaches.\n",
    "The first requires knowing the chemical composition of each chemical species.\n",
    "For example, atomic mass analysis ??ref-MEMOTE counts the atoms of each type in the reactants and compares each count with the corresponding counts of atoms in the products.\n",
    "This approach has two challenges.\n",
    "First, the modeler must use annotations or other means to expose the chemical structure of species; this is not always available (especially\n",
    "for larger molecules that can be in many different chemical states of phosphorylation, methylation, etc.).\n",
    "A second problem is that it forces the modeler to write unnecessarly detailed reactions.\n",
    "For example, ``ATP2_MODEL`` fails this kind of mass balance checking because there is no accounting for the $\\gamma$ phosphate of ``ATP``.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is to check for a condition that is a bit weaker than mass balance.\n",
    "Referred to as **stoichiometric inconsistency**, such inconsistencies are detected if there is no assignment of masses to\n",
    "the chemical species such that the reaction network (without boundary reactions) neither creates nor destroys chemical species.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical details of this latter approach are described in ??ref-Shin for details.\n",
    "The paper introduces the GAMES algorithm that uses graphical techniques to analyze mass equivalences implied by the reaction network.\n",
