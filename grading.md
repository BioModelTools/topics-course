## Course Grade

The course grade consists of the following components and percentages:

Homework: 20%

Paper review: 30%

Course project: 50%

## Homework

There will be 2 homeworks, each worth 10 points.
The homeworks are intended to provide experience with constructing and evaluating
models.
The homeworks will use the Antimony python library to model biological systems
and python matplotlib to plot results.

- Homework 1: Due Oct 24 - [gene regulation](https://github.com/ModelEngineering/advancing-biomedical-models/blob/master/homework/Assignment1.pdf)

- Homework 2: Reconstruct the model in the Koholoenko paper cited in the references page.

## Paper review

Students will present and review one research paper on biomedical modeling.

## Course Project

The project will be to define and partially develop a tool that aids in building biomedical models.
The grading rubric will emphasize innovation in the problem addressed and the benefits that could
be provided by the tool.
Students are expected to do a partial implementation that would be suitable for a proof-of-concept demo.
