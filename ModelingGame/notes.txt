.  The initial-Antimony-model.txt file has a parameter, 'K3_6', which is not involved in any of the reactions - you can remove that parameter (it should have been removed). I uploaded a new file on Canvas for this.

2. You can assume that the double repression or double activation regulations are OR gates as previously mentioned, where either or, or both,  can enact the corresponding regulation. These should have a parameter 'K3_ ' involved in the rate law. We will assume this indicates that the binding of the second species to the promoter is not independent of the first species being bound. 

3. The original experiment-price-list.pdf file was not consistent with the data being generated. This has been updated to show that the time-course data should cover 20 hours (1200 minutes). 

4. After reviewing the "current knowledge" Antimony script for the Modeling Game model - it seems for double activation or double repression, OR gate logic, which allows either species alone or both species together, is used.
